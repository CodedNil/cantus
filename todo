make it only pull spotify progress info if mpris didnt get
redo the warp effect
fix flicker when song changes, its updating progress before the queue changes
particles as the song is playing between the dark_width
below the current tracks bar, have buttons to set star rating, add to specific pinned playlists
compact the artist name onto two lines
click and drag to seek
click songs ahead or behind to skip to that in the queue
show previous song, somehow track that
smoothly enter new songs into the right side, dont crop them in, have one waiting then in a smooth quick animation it pops in like a bubble
pulse animation when play or pause like zen
show the waveform of the song
differentiate between the countdown vs current songs current progress - maybe make currently playing song have an animated glow outline?
