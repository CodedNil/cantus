stack previous songs so a bit of each is visible up to like 6 songs
run as a proper windows layer-shell bar
show the song title to the left of the playback bar when its not visible to the right

improve the particle emission:
fix the dodgy sprayed off particles due to tiny errors in playback position sampling
make it more uniform so it evenly emits along the surface instead of looking pulsey


todo when audio analysis is possible again:
show the waveform of the song
particles emit faster based on the tempo
valence (0-1) - positivity - vibrancy boost to the colours, use lighter colour theme too
tempo (50-200) - for animation speed
acousticness (0-1)
danceability (0-1)
energy (0-1)
instrumentalness (0-1)
loudness (-60-0db)
