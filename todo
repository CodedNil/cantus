interaction:
actually seek/skip song on drag release
stack previous songs so a bit of each is visible up to like 6 songs
play/pause
volume


animations:
in the center of the now playing now, split out a pause or play icon when the state changes
pause should take a chunk and move it left and another right
also show this when hovering


misc:
run as a proper windows layer-shell bar
use local playerctl for seek and skip as much as possible
redo svg rendering with BezPath::from_svg


todo when audio analysis is possible again:
show the waveform of the song
particles emit faster based on the tempo
valence (0-1) - positivity - vibrancy boost to the colours, use lighter colour theme too
tempo (50-200) - for animation speed
acousticness (0-1)
danceability (0-1)
energy (0-1)
instrumentalness (0-1)
loudness (-60-0db)
