interaction:
below the current tracks bar, have buttons to set star rating, add to specific pinned playlists
click and drag to seek
stack previous songs so a bit of each is visible up to like 6 songs


animations:
switching from the lower to full rounded corner when its cropped
smoothly enter new songs into the right side, dont crop them in, have one waiting then in a smooth quick animation it pops in like a bubble
pulse animation when play or pause like zen
maybe make currently playing song have an animated glow outline, when the song is changed the new one should do have a heavy pulse


particles:
pulse emission based on songs current analysis (loudness etc at that point)
entry particles for songs on the right that are growing (very subtle in comparison)


shrink dependencies:
wasm-bindgen
wgpu optional features


cleanup:
dirty the queue if its drastically changed
for very short songs they dont fit the whole height with background


misc:
lyrics along the bottom
compile feature to run as a winit window instead of a layer_shell bar


todo when audio analysis is possible again:
show the waveform of the song
particles emit faster based on the tempo
valence (0-1) - positivity - vibrancy boost to the colours, use lighter colour theme too
tempo (50-200) - for animation speed
acousticness (0-1)
danceability (0-1)
energy (0-1)
instrumentalness (0-1)
loudness (-60-0db)
