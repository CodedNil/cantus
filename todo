below the current tracks bar, have buttons to set star rating, add to specific pinned playlists
click and drag to seek
click songs ahead or behind to skip to that in the queue

show previous song, somehow track that
smoothly enter new songs into the right side, dont crop them in, have one waiting then in a smooth quick animation it pops in like a bubble

show the waveform of the song
grab the acousticness, danceability, energy etc and factor that into the animation/colours?
lyrics along the bottom

pulse animation when play or pause like zen
maybe make currently playing song have an animated glow outline, when the song is changed the new one should do have a heavy pulse


get primary colours per song image, give the text complementary colour
give the particles a random pick from the primary colours (exclude grayscale ones)


animations:
switching from the lower to full rounded corner when its cropped


shrink dependencies:
wasm-bindgen
wgpu optional features


cleanup:
tidy CantusLayer, remove the unneeded variables, try to reduce how much of it is Option<T>
dont allow multiple spotify interactions concurrently to avoid bugs
dirty the queue if its drastically changed

fix weird rendering of the track bar when its really narrow
