below the current tracks bar, have buttons to set star rating, add to specific pinned playlists
click and drag to seek
click songs ahead or behind to skip to that in the queue

show previous song, somehow track that
smoothly enter new songs into the right side, dont crop them in, have one waiting then in a smooth quick animation it pops in like a bubble

show the waveform of the song

pulse animation when play or pause like zen
maybe make currently playing song have an animated glow outline, when the song is changed the new one should do have a heavy pulse


get primary colours per song image, give the text complementary colour
give the particles a random pick from the primary colours (exclude grayscale ones)




shrink dependencies:
wasm-bindgen
wgpu optional features



cleanup:
when spotify isnt open it doesnt render at all, should just ignore mpris
tidy CantusLayer, remove the unneeded variables, try to reduce how much of it is Option<T>
