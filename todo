interaction:
way to cancel a drag seek? right click?
stack previous songs so a bit of each is visible up to like 6 songs

animations:
instead of showing unincluded playlists for current song, only show that when hovering on that track, even if theres no room

misc:
run as a proper windows layer-shell bar
fix the dodgy sprayed off particles due to tiny errors in playback position sampling
show the song title to the left of the playback bar when its not visible to the right


todo when audio analysis is possible again:
show the waveform of the song
particles emit faster based on the tempo
valence (0-1) - positivity - vibrancy boost to the colours, use lighter colour theme too
tempo (50-200) - for animation speed
acousticness (0-1)
danceability (0-1)
energy (0-1)
instrumentalness (0-1)
loudness (-60-0db)
