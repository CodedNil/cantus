interaction:
actually seek/skip song on drag release
stack previous songs so a bit of each is visible up to like 6 songs
show the play/pause button when hovering, click to play/pause
volume (rendered onto the playback bar as a vertical colour fill, scroll to change)
instead of showing unincluded playlists for current song, only show that when hovering on that track, even if theres no room


animations:
show the highlight animation when you click to seek


misc:
run as a proper windows layer-shell bar
use local playerctl for seek and skip as much when viable
fix the dodgy sprayed off particles due to tiny errors in playback position sampling


todo when audio analysis is possible again:
show the waveform of the song
particles emit faster based on the tempo
valence (0-1) - positivity - vibrancy boost to the colours, use lighter colour theme too
tempo (50-200) - for animation speed
acousticness (0-1)
danceability (0-1)
energy (0-1)
instrumentalness (0-1)
loudness (-60-0db)
