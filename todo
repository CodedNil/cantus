interaction:
actually seek/skip song on drag release
stack previous songs so a bit of each is visible up to like 6 songs
play/pause
volume


animations:
pulse animation when play or pause like zen
maybe make currently playing song have an animated glow outline, when the song is changed the new one should do have a heavy pulse
ratings showing and hiding should fade in and out


misc:
lyrics along the bottom
run as a proper windows layer-shell bar


todo when audio analysis is possible again:
show the waveform of the song
particles emit faster based on the tempo
valence (0-1) - positivity - vibrancy boost to the colours, use lighter colour theme too
tempo (50-200) - for animation speed
acousticness (0-1)
danceability (0-1)
energy (0-1)
instrumentalness (0-1)
loudness (-60-0db)
